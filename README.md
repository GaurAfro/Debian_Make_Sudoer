I apologize for the oversight. Let me provide a corrected step-by-step guide for using the `add_current_user_to_sudoers.sh` script with `curl`:

### **Using the `add_current_user_to_sudoers.sh` Script with `curl`**

This guide will walk you through the process of executing the `add_current_user_to_sudoers.sh` script using `curl`.

#### **Prerequisites**:
1. **Install `curl`**: If it's not already installed, you can get it with:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install curl
   ```

#### **Instructions**:

1. **Switch to the Superuser**: Before running the script, ensure you are the superuser (root).
   ```bash
   su
   ```

2. **Execute the Script**: Now, execute the following command:
   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://github.com/GaurAfro/Debian_Make_Sudoer/blob/ea62bf4d6c52ce2bc8115573a741702cbb28a942/add_current_user_to_sudoers.sh | bash
   ```

3. **Script Execution**: The script will run and automatically configure the necessary settings to grant sudo privileges to the current user.

4. **Verification**: To verify, exit from the superuser mode:
   ```bash
   exit
   ```
   Then, try a sudo command to ensure the current user has been added to the `sudoers`:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

5. **Completion**: If the `sudo` command runs without any permission issues, the script has successfully added the user to the `sudoers`.

#### **Safety Reminder**:
Always ensure you trust the source of scripts you're fetching and executing directly from the web. It's a good practice to review the content of scripts before running them, especially as a superuser.
